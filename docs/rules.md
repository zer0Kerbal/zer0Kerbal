* Ask questions and  learn from others (as you are doing here); learn, adapt, improvise, improve - (Kerbal Kaizen approach) and develop your individual style
* Approach documentation as a player - what do I want to see?  Think journalism and the W?W?W?W?W?H? (W5H?)
* Documentation is marketing. Suggest not taking it too serious - but... it is your Brand
* Take an iterative approach - which simple means update the behind-the-scene gears every version of every mod.
* With the iterative approach, use a semantic numbering system in the file name of the template, and include the file version in the templates.
  * A.B.C.D or A.B.C (aka #.#.#.# or #.#.#) is an example.
  * standardize what each number means (major.minor.patch.build or major.minor.patch)
  * write this down - I do here
    * for me: 
      * build (least significant digit): inconsequential hanges like typos, and other minor things - changes to documentation, url, etc.
      * patch: slight changes that don't (normally) affect saves but more than just a minor
      * minor:  standard version updates (like the one you posted about)
      * major: (most significant digit): game changing changes - like a new owner
      * I reserve several key version for things
        *  x.9.9.9 or x.x.9.99 are pre-releases or adoptions
        *  x.9.9.x or x.x.9.x are for betas
